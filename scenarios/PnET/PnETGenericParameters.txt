LandisData PnETGenericParameters
PnETGenericParameters Value
>> Some PnET parameters (e.g., SLWDel, Q10, DVPD1, DVPD2) are hard to estimate and most studies use generic values (e.g., Aber et al 1995, Ollinger and Smith 2005).
>>------------------------------------
DVPD1				0.05 << GUSTAFSTON uses
DVPD2				2 
Q10				2  <<GUSTAFSTON uses
FolLignin			0.2 <<GUSTAFSTON uses
InitialNSC 			7 
DNSC				0.05  <<target NSCfraction (GUSTAFSTON=0.05) has little effect on cohort competition unless so low that cohort has minimal reserves to survive stress, or so high that species can rarely be stressed enough to die.
PsnAgeRed			3 << A value of 3 seems to work well for all species in the boreal biome, GUSTAFSTON proposed 5 for temperate forest species. However, our value allows us to control most aspects of the shape of the biomass growth curve of Pothier and Savard [1998]  
>>BFolResp 0.1
CFracBiomass			0.47 << C content of biomass (IPCC value)
PreventEstablishment	false<< true during the calibration since we are calibrating monoculture species and we followed  single cohort. equal=false for simulation at the  landscape scale
TOwood 0.01 << GUSTAFSTON uses
TOroot 0.02 << GUSTAFSTON uses .02 ? (0.016 McKenzie et al. 2019 ) both values were tested
MaxCanopyLayers			3
MaxDevLyrAv 10000
IMAX 5
MaxPest 0.43 >> MaxPest is dependent on the PnET-Succession time step, meaning that you must reset its value when you change the time step. 
wythers true
PrecipEvents	11
Dtemp true  >> True=eric's "new" way of doing it like pnet-II.  False="Arjan's" old way of doing it using ftemp.
